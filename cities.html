    <h1>Last 3 cities I have lived in</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Augusta</li>
        <li>Stuttgart</li>
        <li>Grafenwhor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I lived in these places mainly because the Army told me to go there. But I did ask to go to Germany. That was a lot of fun.</p>
    <h1>Top 3 cities I would still like to visit.</h1>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Tokyo <span>&#128077; &#128077; &#128077;</span></li></strong>
        <li>Bogata <span>&#128077; &#128077;</span></li>
        <li>Toronto <span>&#128077;</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I have already traveled to a lot of cool places. But these are really the places I still haven't been to yet.</p>
